                                            Question 1
```
Find:\s+
replace:,
```
First String,Second,1.22,3.4
Second,More Text,1.555555,2.2220
Third,x,3,124
 
I used find "\s+" which finds spaces between words and replace with a "," 
  
                                           Question 2
```
Find: (\w*), (\w*), (.*)
Replace: \2 \1 \(\3)

The expression (\w*), (\w*), (.*) highlights each word in the string and replace them with 
with the expression \2 \1 \(\3). The replace expression arranges the names according to last and first names, whereas the space ensures spacing between the names. The last command puts the last string in a bracket.

                                    Question 3
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
 0003 Winder Slide.mp3
 0004 Walking Cane.mp3
I used the eexpression "(\w+[^0-9]*\w)" to highlight the text of interest and replaced it with "\1\n". The expression "\w+" selected the set of texts (either numerical or words) whereas the expression [^0-9]*highlight every other word format except numerical values. The "\w" selected the remaining numerical value.
I placed the eexpression in parenthesis so that I can wrap it as one entity. The "\1" expression
took the wrapped entity and the "\n" expression break the line from that point pushing every other 
sentence on that role to the next line.  
 Georgia Horseshoe_0001.mp3 

                                          Question 4
Georgia Horseshoe_.mp30001
Billy In The Lowground_.mp30002
Winder Slide_.mp30003
Walking Cane_.mp30004

I used the eexpression "([^0-9]*)(\d+)(.*)" to highlight the text of interest and replaced it with "\1\3\2". The expression in the replace section selects the first two words and the underscore ([^0-9]*) followed by .mp3 (.*)and the four digits (\d+).

                                         Question 5
C_pennsylvanicus,44
C_herculeanus,3
M_punctiventris,4
L_neoniger,55

The expression "(\w)(\w+),(\w+),(\w+).(\w),(\w+)" highlights the entire word string and replaces it with the expression "\1_\3,\6". The expression in the replace section picks the first letter of the species name (\w),adds an underscore and the genus(\w+) followed by a comma and the last number(s)(\w+).

                                        Question 6
C_penn,44
C_herc,3
M_punc,4
L_neon,55

The expression "(\w)(\w+),(\w{4})(\w+),(\w+).(\w),(\w+)" highlights the entire word string and replaces it with the expression "\1_\3,\7". The expression in the replace section picks the first letter of the species name(\w),adds an underscore and the first four letters of the genus(\w{4}) followed by a comma and the last number(s)(\w+).

                                       Question 7
Campen, 44, 10.2
Camher, 3, 10.5
Myrpun, 4, 12.2
Lasneo, 55, 3.3

 The expression "(\w{3})(\w+),(\w{3})(\w+),(\w+).(\d),(\d+)" highlights the entire word string and replaces it with the expression "\1\3, \7, \5.\6". The expression in the replace section merges the first three letters of the species name(\w{3}) with the first three letters of the genus(\w{3}) followed by a comma. Next,the last number(s)(\d+) from the original word string is selected, followed by a comma and the decimal number (first digit(s)(\w+), a period and the last digit(\d)).
